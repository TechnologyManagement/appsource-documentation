# Clever Credit Page
This page provides an overview of your customers, how much money they owe you and how old the debt is. A column will be shown for each of the ageing bands that has been defined on the [Clever Credit Setup](.\clever-credit-setup) page. By default these are:
- Not Due
- 30 Days
- 60 Days
- 90 Days
- 120 Days
- 120+ Days

Each customer on the page is highlighted according to how old their oldest unpaid invoice is.

Drilldown on any of the figures on the page to see the ledger entries that make up that figure. You can also click on any of the column headings to sort the list by that column. For example, you might want to see a list of customers sorted by Balance descending.

## Factboxes
Several factboxes are shown on the right hand side of the page with further information about the customer. Statistics are shown with links to posted and open documents and contact details.

### Payment
The "Payment" section shows the "Avg. Days to Pay" and "Avg. Overdue Days" figure for the currently selected customer. Click on these figures to see the invoices that are included in the calculation and a chart which shows the rolling average payment days for this customer.

This chart allows you to see at a glance any trend in the customer's payments over time. This detail allows you to prioritise customers that are taking longer to pay invoices than they used to.

### Interactions
The Interactions factbox shows details of past interactions with the customer. You can check any notes that have been recorded in past interactions and be armed with all the facts before you call the customer.
