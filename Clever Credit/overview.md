Clever Credit
=============

Overview
========

Clever Credit provides you and your team with a screen to see exactly where your
money is. See a list of your customers with a breakdown of who owes you and when
it was due. Drilldown on the summary figures to view the invoice details. From
there, make a phone call to the customer through Skype in a single click and
update the status of each invoice.

As well as chasing money that customers owe you, Clever Credit helps prevent bad
debt in the first place. Place sales documents for customers who are over their
credit limit, or who have overdue invoices, on ‘credit hold’. These documents
are displayed in a new list for your authorised credit controllers to review and
release.
